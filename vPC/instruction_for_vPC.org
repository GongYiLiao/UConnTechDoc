* Introduction

[[http://vpc.uconn.edu][UCONN's vPC]] (=vpc.uconn.edu=) service let student can access to proprietary software from any campus PC or their own PC or laptops[fn:1].
For students who finish their homework on vPC, the two most important steps are saving the files (like the output files generated by =SAS=) and printing those files they will hand in during the class. 
In this instruction document, we assume three scenarios:

[fn:1] The service evaluated as quite stable while this document written.

- A student finishes his/her homework on vPC via a campus PC(library PC or Lab PC) and wants to save those files in his/her USB flash drive then brings them home to print out using his/her own printer.
- A student finishes his/her homework on vPC and wants to print file using UCONN's HuskyPrint Service
- A Student finishes his/her homework and send them as e-mail on vPC.

  
* Save files in USB drive and bring it home to print.

To save files those are created and edited within vPC, please go to [[http://vpc.uconn.edu/help/save-to-a-usb-drive-with-view-for-windows][UCONN's vPC page about connect a USB drive]] 
(=vpc.uconn.edu/help/save-to-a-usb-drive-with-view-for-windows=) for more detail.


* Save and print files within vPC
Just like the first scenario, the only difference is using UCONN's [[http://www.print.uconn.edu][HuskyPrint]] service (=www.print.uconn.edu=).
Please go to it's web site for more detail. 

* To send files as e-mail on vPC.
Another easy approach is sending those vPC files as attachments of an e-mail. 
To send those files as e-mail attachments, just save files on =P= drive:

#+begin_center
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=0.7\textwidth
[[./P-drive.png]]
#+end_center

Once you finish saving the file, open the browser and connect to any web-based e-mail service to send the files as the attachments of that e-mail.
